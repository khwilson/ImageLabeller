# Simple Jupyter Labeler

Sometimes you just need to dash off some quick categorical labels for images.
This is my ipywidgets based labeler.

Mostly here so I can remembrer, but feel free to use it too!

## Getting up and going

We require recent versions of Jupyter, Python 3, pillow, and numpy (as of April 2019).
Once those are installed, you should point the `images` array in the notebook to
a list of images you'd like labeled.
